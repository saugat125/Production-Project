# ðŸ©º Symptom-Based Disease Prediction and EHR System

A full-stack healthcare application that uses machine learning to predict possible diseases based on symptoms, recommends specialized doctors, and manages patient medical records securely using an integrated Electronic Health Record (EHR) system.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project aims to provide users with an intelligent and accessible platform for early disease detection and healthcare management. By entering a list of symptoms, users receive AI-powered predictions of possible illnesses, along with doctor recommendations. It also allows users to maintain a digital health profile and track previous consultations and predictions securely.
